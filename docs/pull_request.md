To create a new pull request use the streamlit application chat function.

Use the command `createpr->` and type the contents of the file you want to include in the PR.

For example if you want to create a PR with the content `Hello World` you would type `createpr->Hello World`

Or if you wanted to create a PR with the content

```
Hi my name is John

Nice to meet you!
```

you would type 
```
createpr->Hi my name is John

Nice to meet you!
```

A new branch will be created in the repo with the content you have provided and a PR will be opened.
