Terraform Stuff <br>
So, we got this Terraform thingy here. It's for doing stuff with Cloudflare. 

Cloudflare <br>
You gotta put your Cloudflare email and token here. It's like "example@hotmail.com" and "your-api-key", but use your real ones, not these.

Some Variable <br>
There's a variable here called domain. It's set to "example.com" by default. You can use it elsewhere in this Terraform thing.

DNS <br>
This part makes a DNS record in Cloudflare. The domain is whatever you set that domain variable to. The name is like a subdomain for the DNS record. The value is some IP address the DNS record goes to. The type is "A", whatever that means. If you set proxied to true, it turns on some Cloudflare proxy thing.

.tf File <br>
Here's what a .tf file looks like for all this:
```
provider "cloudflare" {
    email = "example@hotmail.com"
    token = "your-api-key"
}

variable "domain" {
    default = "example.com"
}

resource "cloudflare_record" "www" {
    domain  = "${var.domain}"
    name    = "www"
    value   = "203.0.113.10"
    type    = "A"
    proxied = true
}
```
